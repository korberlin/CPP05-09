## Module Breakdown

### **CPP05: Try/Catch and Exceptions**


**Description:**  
This module introduces exception handling in C++, providing a framework for writing safer, more reliable programs.

**Key Topics Covered:**  
- Try/Catch blocks  
- Exception hierarchy and custom exceptions  
- Abstract classes and polymorphism  
- Factory methods  

**What I Learned:**  
- Using exceptions to handle runtime errors gracefully.  
- Designing robust programs with proper error propagation.  
- Implementing factory methods to create objects dynamically.

### **CPP06: C++ Casts**


**Description:**  
An introduction to the various casting mechanisms in C++, focusing on safe and effective type conversions.

**Key Topics Covered:**  
- `static_cast` for compile-time type conversions  
- `reinterpret_cast` for low-level type manipulation  
- `dynamic_cast` for runtime polymorphic type checks  

**What I Learned:**  
- The strengths and weaknesses of different C++ casts.  
- How to use casts safely without introducing undefined behavior.  
- Practical applications of casting in polymorphism and type conversions.

### **CPP07: C++ Templates**


**Description:**  
This module focuses on templates, one of the most powerful features of C++, enabling generic programming.

**Key Topics Covered:**  
- Function templates for reusable algorithms  
- Class templates for data structures  
- Template specialization for customization  

**What I Learned:**  
- Writing flexible and reusable code with templates.  
- Using template specialization to handle unique cases.  
- Designing algorithms that work seamlessly with different data types.

### **CPP08: Templated Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms**


**Description:**  
An exploration of templated containers, iterators, and algorithms, focusing on efficient data manipulation.

**Key Topics Covered:**  
- Standard Template Library (STL) containers  
- Iterators for traversing collections  
- Algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating data  

**What I Learned:**  
- Leveraging STL containers like `std::vector` and `std::map`.  
- Using iterators to navigate and modify containers.  
- Implementing algorithms with a focus on performance and clarity.

### **CPP09: STL**


**Description:**  
The final module in the series dives into the STL, highlighting its utility in solving complex problems efficiently.

**Key Topics Covered:**  
- File manipulation with `std::ifstream`  
- Containers like `std::vector`, `std::deque`, and `std::map`  
- Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) with `std::stack`  
- Merge sort and advanced algorithmic techniques  

**What I Learned:**  
- Solving real-world problems using STL containers.  
- Implementing algorithms like merge sort with STL tools.  
- Parsing input data efficiently with `std::ifstream` and containers.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-modules.git
   cd cpp-modules
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Module:**
   Each module is stored in its own folder:
   ```bash
   cd CPP05  # Replace with CPP06, CPP07, etc.
   ```

3. **Build and Run:**
   Use the provided Makefile to compile and test the programs:
   ```bash
   make
   ./program_name  # Replace with the executable name
   ```
